It may not be general knowledge, but Gerrit Rietveld created numerous designs for children among which this ‘Kruiwagentje’ wheel barrow from 1923 (beech / multiplex). A both simple and powerful design with strong geometric shapes in the colour combination red, blue, yellow, black and white. Now launched again by RIETVELD by rietveld.
